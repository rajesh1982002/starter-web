BREAKING NEWS: Democrats subpoena Rudy Giuliani as part of impeachment inquiry by citing his wild cable TV interviews, telling Donald Trump's personal attorney to hand over documents about his bid to dig dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine
Three Democratic committee chairs demanded Giuliani hand over information by October 15
They cited his contentious interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo and his brandishing purported text messages during a Fox News interview
Giuliani has said 'of course' he would testify, has said he wouldn't testify, and said he would testify only after consulting his client President Trump
